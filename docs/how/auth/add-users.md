# Adding Users to DataHub

Users can log into DataHub in 2 ways:

1. Static credentials
2. Single Sign-On via [OpenID Connect](https://www.google.com/search?q=openid+connect&oq=openid+connect&aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433i512j0i512l4j69i60l2j69i61.1468j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

Option 1 is useful for running proof-of-concept exercises, while Option 2 is highly recommended for deploying DataHub in production.


# Configuring static credentials

## Step 1: Define a user.props file

To define a set of username / password combinations that should be allowed to log in to DataHub, create a new file called `user.props`. This file should contain username:password combinations, with 1 user per line. For example, to create a `user.props` file with 2 users, the root
"datahub" user and a custom user "johndoe", we would define the following file:

```
# user.props
datahub:rootpassword
johndoe:johnspassword
```

We strongly recommend keeping a root user named `datahub` in your user.props. Otherwise, the root user will not be able to log in!

## Step 2: Mount user.props file to Docker container

Once you've defined a `user.props` file, you'll need to mount the file into the `datahub-frontend` Docker container at the following path:

```
/datahub-frontend/conf/user.props
```

### Docker Compose

You'll need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to mount a container volume mapping your local user.props to the standard location inside the container.

For example, to mount a user.props file that is stored on my local filesystem at `/tmp/datahub/user.props`, we'd modify the YAML for the 
`datahub-web-react` config to look like the following:

```aidl
  datahub-frontend-react:
    build:
      context: ../
      dockerfile: docker/datahub-frontend/Dockerfile
    image: linkedin/datahub-frontend-react:${DATAHUB_VERSION:-head}
    .....
    # The new stuff
    volumes:
      - <path-to-your-user.props>:/datahub-frontend/conf/user.props
```

Once you've made this change, restarting DataHub enable authentication for the configured users.

### Helm

You'll need to create a Kubernetes secret, then mount the file as a volume to the `datahub-frontend` pod. 

First, create a secret from your local `user.props` file

```shell
kubectl create secret generic datahub-users-secret --from-file=user.props=./<path-to-your-user.props>
```

Then, configure your `values.yaml` to add the volume to the `datahub-frontend` container.

```YAML
datahub-frontend:
  ...
  extraVolumes:
    - name: datahub-users
      secret:
        defaultMode: 0444
        secretName:  datahub-users-secret
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: datahub-users
      mountPath: /datahub-frontend/conf/user.props
      subPath: user.props
```

Note that if you update the secret you will need to restart the `datahub-frontend` pods so the changes are reflected. To update the secret in-place you can run something like this.

```shell
kubectl create secret generic datahub-users-secret --from-file=user.props=./<path-to-your-user.props> -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl apply -f -
```

## URNs

URNs are identifiers that uniquely identify an Entity on DataHub. The usernames defined in the `user.props` file will be used to generate the DataHub user "urn", which uniquely identifies
the user on DataHub. The urn is computed as:

```
urn:li:corpuser:{username}
```

## Caveats

If you add a new username / password to the `user.props` file, no other information about the user will exist
about the user in DataHub (full name, email, bio, etc). This means that you will not be able to search to find the user.

In order to add information about the user in DataHub, you can use our Python Emitter SDK to produce aspects for the CorpUser,
where the URN will be computed as `urn:li:corpuser:{username}`, where `username` is the identifier defined in the user.props file.

# Configuring SSO via OpenID Connect

Setting up SSO via OpenID Connect means that users will be able to login to DataHub via a central Identity Provider such as

- Azure AD
- Okta 
- Keycloak
- Ping!
- Google Identity

and more. 

This option is recommended for production deployments of DataHub. For detailed information about configuring DataHub to use OIDC to
perform authentication, check out [OIDC Authentication](./sso/configure-oidc-react.md). 

## URNs

URNs are identifiers that uniquely identify an Entity on DataHub. The username received from an Identity Provider 
when a user logs into DataHub via OIDC is used to construct a unique identifier for the user on DataHub. The urn is computed as:

```
urn:li:corpuser:<extracted-username>
```

For information about configuring which OIDC claim should be used as the username for Datahub, check out the [OIDC Authentication](./sso/configure-oidc-react.md) doc.
