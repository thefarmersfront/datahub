# DataHub Town Halls

We hold regular virtual town hall meetings to meet with DataHub community. 
Currently it's held on the fourth Thursday of every month (with some exceptions such as holiday weekends).
It's the perfect venue to meet the team behind DataHub and other users, as well as to ask higher-level questions, such as roadmap and product direction.
From time to time we also use the opportunity to showcase upcoming features.

## Meeting Invite & Agenda

You can join with this link https://zoom.datahubproject.io, or [RSVP](https://rsvp.datahubproject.io/) to get a calendar invite - this will always have the most up-to-date agenda for upcoming sessions.
