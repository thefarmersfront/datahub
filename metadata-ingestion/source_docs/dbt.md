# dbt

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

Works with `acryl-datahub` out of the box.

## Capabilities

This plugin pulls metadata from dbt's artifact files:

- [dbt manifest file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json)
  - This file contains model, source and lineage data.
- [dbt catalog file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/catalog-json)
  - This file contains schema data.
  - dbt does not record schema data for Ephemeral models, as such datahub will show Ephemeral models in the lineage, however there will be no associated schema for Ephemeral models
- [dbt sources file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/sources-json)
  - This file contains metadata for sources with freshness checks.
  - We transfer dbt's freshness checks to DataHub's last-modified fields.
  - Note that this file is optional – if not specified, we'll use time of ingestion instead as a proxy for time last-modified.
- target_platform:
  - The data platform you are enriching with dbt metadata.
  - [data platforms](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub/blob/master/metadata-service/restli-impl/src/main/resources/DataPlatformInfo.json)
- load_schemas:
  - Load schemas from dbt catalog file, not necessary when the underlying data platform already has this data.
- use_identifiers:
  - Use model [identifier](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/identifier) instead of model name if defined (if not, default to model name).
- node_type_pattern:
  - Use this filter to exclude and include node types using allow or deny method

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: "dbt"
  config:
    # Coordinates
    manifest_path: "./path/dbt/manifest_file.json"
    catalog_path: "./path/dbt/catalog_file.json"
    sources_path: "./path/dbt/sources_file.json"

    # Options
    target_platform: "my_target_platform_id"
    load_schemas: True # note: if this is disabled

sink:
  # sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

| `use_identifiers`         |         | `False`   | Whether to use model identifiers instead of names, if defined (if not, default to names)                                                             |
